"""
Tool for classic Unity 3D physics — raycasting, rigidbodies, colliders, joints, physics settings.
Actions: raycast, raycast_all, overlap_sphere, overlap_box, list_rigidbodies, get_rigidbody,
         set_rigidbody, list_colliders, get_physics_settings, set_physics_settings.
Uses built-in UnityEngine.Physics — no package dependency.
