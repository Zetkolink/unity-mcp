Tool for Unity lighting — lights, probes, lightmapping, environment/render settings.
Actions: list_lights, get_light, set_light, bake, cancel_bake, get_bake_status,
         list_probes, get_probe, get_environment, set_environment, get_lightmap_settings.
Uses built-in UnityEngine/UnityEditor lighting APIs — no package dependency.
